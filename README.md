# OSU Mercury Robotics Challenge 2020
### This repository documents the 2020 OSU Mercury Robotics Challenge.

v1.0.1 of the 2020 Competition Handbook has been released.

This GitHub repository tracks any updates in the Handbook as they're being made. Please note that these updates are under development and are not binding for the 2020 Competition. Please refer to the latest [release](https://github.com/osu-mercury-robotics/2020-Competition/releases) or the [2020 Track Pack](https://mercury.okstate.edu/content/mercury-challenge) for the version that will be used in the competition. 

# 2020 Competition Handbook v1.0.1

The 2020 Competition Handbook includes a few major changes from previous years. Some of them are as follows: 

* **50 mile limitation -** The restriction of the operators being at least fifty miles from the competition venue has been **removed**
* **Autonomy -** There is an element of autonomy in this year's competition. There will be an obstacle avoidance section with three configurations that vary in required autonomy. Teams which attempt configurations requiring more autonomy will be eligible for more points. 
* **Bypasses -** This year's track will include multiple routes bypassing sections. When compared to previous years, this removes some of the linearity of the track but greatly increases teams' freedom to spend time where deemed most effective. 
* **Time Bonus -** There is a maximum 30 percent time bonus. This bonus decreases proportionally as the run time nears the total time allotted. Teams that bypass more than two sections will be ineligible for the time bonus. 

As always, we can't wait to see everyone at the 11th annual Mercury Robotics Competition!
